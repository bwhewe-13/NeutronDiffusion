A neutron diffusion solution for slab, spherical, and cylindrical one-dimensional 
geometries for steady state, k-eigenvalue, and time-dependent problems. Written 
in Python and accelerated with Numba.

## Current Capabilities
- One dimensional slab, cylinder, and sphere geometries
- Vacuum, reflective, and albedo boundary conditions
- Matrix solve for k-eigenvalue power iteration


## Future Capabilities
- Clean up current code, add documentation
- Non-matrix solution to k-eigenvalue power iteration using Gauss-Seidel
- Time dependent problems
- DSA accelerator
- Expand to two dimensions
